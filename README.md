 ### 5. Surface

 we have paid a lot of attention to the color scheme. And used 3 colors throught the website. we've chosen orange for its vividness and black and white to contrast with the orange.

 * Font Selection
 * Google font
 we've used Cormorant Garamond for the main font, and Lora as a backup font for this website. Both fonts are from the Serif font family. This was done to enhance the formalness and the seriousness of the topic, since this quiz is about tech comapanies.
 * The fonts are from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

## Technologies

 The technologies used in this project were HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The HTML was used to create the structure of the page, the CSS was used to style the page and the JavaScript was used to make the entire quiz function.

 * HTML5
 * CSS3
 * JavaScript
 * GitHub

  Validation results:
  <img src="assets/images/html-validation.png">

  + CSS

 During the testing, one error and one warning was found and corrected and thus passing through the official wc css validation  [W3C validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/). 

 validation results

 + JavaScript
 Jshint was used for the javascript validation. There were over 40 warnings but eventually everything was corrected and website passed through the jshint validation. [Jshhint validator](https://jshint.com/)
 <img src="assets/images/jshint-validation.png">

 ### Manual Testing

   + Desktop

 Everything is working good Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, labtop and large tablet screen . Page loads and all of the page features are working.

   + Mobile
 
 Tested with Samsung s21, Samsung s22, Galaxy tab s8 ultra, and iPhone XR. It is responsive as intended.

   +  chrome dev tools lighthouse

 <img src="assets/images/lighthouse.png">

 As it's shown on the image, the the accessibilty score is 90/100. This is due the form on the page. IF form id is removed then form wont connect the javascript functions and hence this issue coudnt be fixed.  .

 + Mozila dev tools.
 Testing on all devices on mozila is good too. 

## Future Features
 1. I would like to add different levels to the quiz.
 2. I would also like to add a current question out of the total questions counter on top of the quiz.
 3. I would also like to add different questions from all topics.
 4. I would also like to add a feature where a group of questions can play against each other. 
 5. i would like to add images and sounds to some of the questions so that it can be engaging for types of players.
 6. I would like to be able to give users the option to select the langauge they prefer so that anyone can play no matter what language they speak.

## Project Bugs and Solutions:
 No known bugs now. But there were quite few problems at every stage. Whenever a problem was fixed another woud apear. Here are some.

 Problems and bugs

 * Problem 1
 array sytax was wrong and it was returning 250 errors 
 fix: fixed array sysntax problem, it was missing = operator at the begining"


 * Problem 2
 questions werent showing on the questions container.
 fix: I was using getelmentbyid eventhough i didnt use id selctor but a class selector.


 * Problem 3

 answerbuttons were overflowing the center div container.
 solution: styled new buttons, made body wider vh, increased container width and height and styled bottons with with flex column direction.

 * Problem 3
 score wasn't showing at the end event though the statements were there. 
 fix: After a call with a tutor i've realised i was putting the statments in the wrong function.


 * Problem 4
 Input button was still displaying after re-start.
 fix: added classlist to hide on the reset function.

 * Problem 5
 I tried to implement different levels feature before quiz starts, so users can have multiple options, from easy to hard.Unfortunetly this problem was complicated and took over 5 days to sort. I used google, stack overflow, course tutors and slack but nothing worked. In the end after trying over more than 20 ways to solve it, I managed to actually do solve it. However due to the emmense time this took, the fact that the submition deadline was closing by, and also due to the fact that although i managed to make 3 diffrent levels with various lengths of queastions, they still werent random because I was using the slice method to devide the questions. 
 fix: In the end i've decided to drop the feature as it was wasting a lot of time, giving a lot of stress and it wasnt metioned in the course guidlines.

 * Problem 6

 After the previous problem took place, I decided to revert back to an old commit before the whole levels incident when the code was still working and showing all 20 questions. fortunetly things where going well and I even started the read me but soon  i realised a big major problem. I coudnt push the newly written code to the live github site. eventually afer googling and I understood that I coudn not push code because I was on branch. and only you can push from branch main.
 fix: After trying 10 different git commands from slack overflow my mentor helped me walk through the problem and how to go back to branch maain. 

 * Problem 7

 After going back to branch main I had to start coding from beggining, thankfully I coppied my code on my noted before the first commit ever happened, but unfortunetly I could only see the html and css code on the local and the live site. The javascript fuctions and the butttons where'nt doing anything. the site was not interactive at all.
 fix: I kept checking and going back the javascript to see if anything is broken and if I messed up the event handelers in any way. After some googling, I realised that after the code was restored to main branch, the javascript link at the bottom the html document was using absolute link for some reason. I change the link to reletive and everthing was working.

 * Some other problems included:
 1: css validation warning for incorrectly linked google fonts.
 2: css validation error for lack of px value.
 3: Jshint 50 plus warnings on for lack of semi colon.
 4: Jshint warning on .5 decimal point use. change it to 0.5 instead.
 5: background image was linking to local browser but not live site. Used reletive file path. 

## Deployment

 The website was deployed to GitHub pages.
