* Font Selection
 * Google font
we've used Cormorant Garamond for the main font, and Lora as a backup font for this website. Both fonts are from the Serif font family. This was done to enhance the formalness and the seriousness of the topic, since this quiz is about tech comapanies.
* The fonts are from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).
